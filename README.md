#The ChargeMyPEV Project

I started this project in mid 2020 during the pandemic. I didnt pour any serious time into it however until 2022 when I broke my foot and had nothing better to do 

When out and about Eskating I always wanted a simple way to be able to check if there as power nearby as in the past it had always been you found one or you knew where 
one was. I tried to create a sort of community lead solution to this but it didnt really take of and fair enough it was pretty poorly executed. 

The source is here not that there is much to look at though
